Checkoff Question 1: As j and k both multiplication opeation, so we need to make sure that they 
change as least as possible. We put j and k in the outer loop. As j multiplies twice in the loop, 
so the speed is fastest when we put j in the outermost loop.

Checkoff Question 2: We put j in the innermost loop so the speed is the slowerest.

Checkoff Question 3: We should put variables that we stride through with the simplest operations 
in the innermost loop.
